# Vanilla-Website
A fully responsive website about cat breeds built exclusively with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project showcases a broad range of front-end development skills: semantic HTML structure, CSS Grid & Flexbox layouts, media queries, responsive units (clamp, min, max, rem, vh, vw, etc.), DOM manipulation, localStorage, and much more. Although the site’s content is in Romanian, it serves as a demonstration of advanced web techniques and best practices, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Overview
**Vanilla-Website** is a front-end project demonstrating various essential and advanced web development features using only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. The chosen theme is **cat breeds**, but the main focus lies in implementing best practices and fulfilling a comprehensive list of technical requirements. All website content is in Romanian, but the showcased coding techniques and responsiveness can be appreciated regardless of language.

## Features
1. **Multiple Pages**  
   - There are **5 separate HTML pages**: *Home*, *Gallery*, *About*, *Care*, and *Account*.
   
2. **Semantic HTML & Accessibility**  
   - Uses semantic tags: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>`–`<h6>`, etc.  
   - Passes HTML validation (W3C HTML Validator).

3. **External CSS & Responsive Design**  
   - All styling is separated into **CSS files**.  
   - **Fully responsive layout** tested on desktop and mobile.  
   - Makes use of **media queries**, relative units (`rem`, `vh`, `vw`, `%`), as well as functions like `clamp()`, `min()`, and `max()` for fluid sizing.  
   - Passes CSS validation (W3C CSS Validator).

4. **Grid & Flexbox Layout**  
   - The layout uses a combination of **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.  
   - The **Gallery** page showcases a responsive grid of images that significantly changes layout on smaller screens.  
   - No tables were used for layout purposes.

5. **Drop-Down Menu**  
   - Includes an **HTML/CSS-only** drop-down menu.

6. **CSS Selectors & Generated Content**  
   - Demonstrates a variety of **CSS selectors** (id, class, tag, child, `:nth-of-type`, etc.).  
   - Employs **`:before`** and **`:after`** pseudo-elements to generate content meaningfully.

7. **Transitions & Animations**  
   - Implements **transition effects** (changing multiple properties at different intervals).  
   - Contains a **CSS animation** that modifies various properties of the same element.

8. **Vanilla JavaScript Integration**  
   - All scripts are in a **separate JavaScript file**.  
   - **DOM manipulation**: selecting elements by id, class, tag, custom CSS selectors, creating & deleting elements.  
   - **Event handling**: listens to mouse and keyboard events, modifies properties accordingly.  
   - **Functional inputs**: text, range, number, radio, checkbox, select, textarea.  
   - **Timers**: uses `setTimeout()` and/or `setInterval()`.  
   - **LocalStorage**: stores a collection of items and retrieves them for session-like behavior.  
   - **Built-in objects**: uses methods from `Math`, `Array`, `String`, `Date`.  
   - **Randomization**: changes properties like color or size randomly.  
   - **classList, target, currentTarget** usage.  
   - **getComputedStyle** and `stopPropagation()` used in a relevant context.  
   - **Form validation**: uses regular expressions for form data checks.  
   - **Ajax/JSON**: fetches data from a local JSON file.  
   - **Session**: basic login/logout functionality with JSON or Storage.  
   - **Canvas & SVG**: integrated meaningfully on at least one page.

9. **Validated & Deployed**  
   - The website has been tested on modern desktop and mobile browsers.  
   - Easily portable to any server or a simple local setup.

## How to Use
1. **Clone or Download** the repository.  
2. Run a local server (e.g., using VS Code Live Server extension or a simple HTTP server).  
3. Open any of the `.html` files (Home, Gallery, About, Care, Account) in your browser.  
4. Explore the pages to see examples of the aforementioned features in action.

## Requirements Fulfillment
- **HTML/CSS**: Semantic tags, responsive design, media queries, Grid/Flexbox, transitions, animations, pseudo-elements, advanced selectors.  
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage, timers, Ajax/JSON, form validation with RegEx, Canvas/SVG usage.  
- **Responsiveness**: Thoroughly tested on desktop and mobile to ensure optimal viewing experience.
